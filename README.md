## Overview

### The challenge

The calculator:

- Should contain buttons for all of the basic math operators you typically find on simple calculators.
- Operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number.
- Should allow users should to be able to string together several operations and get the right answer.
- Should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.
- Should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.
- Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.
- Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0…
- Users should be able to type in their prefered decimal number. Thus, there should be a point button.
- Should have a keyboard support.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS animations and transitions
- Vanila JavaScript
- JavaScript DOM manipulation

### What I learned

```html
<h1>
  I recap my knowledge about adding a favicon and also HTML icons. I also learnt
  about how to structure HTML for easy Flexbox styling
</h1>
```

```css
.what-I-learnt-about-CSS {
  I learned how to use flexbox for layouts.
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("I learned more about DOM manipulation and event listeners");
};
```

### Continued development

The calculator currently doesn't have the keyboard support functionality, I will be adding it and any other useful feature I think should be added.

### Useful resources

- [Interneting Is Hard](https://internetingishard.netlify.app/html-and-css/flexbox/index.html) - This website helped me in getting clear understanding of Flexbox and how to work with it.
- [OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/?model=text-davinci-002-render-sha) - I use ChatGPT to get simple explanations of complex syntax and the ones I just met.
